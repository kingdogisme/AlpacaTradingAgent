> AlpacaTradingAgent framework is designed for research and educational purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our enhanced framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles while providing real-time market connectivity and execution capabilities.

### Enhanced Analyst Team (5 Agents)

Clone AlpacaTradingAgent:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huygiatrng/AlpacaTradingAgent.git
cd AlpacaTradingAgent
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required APIs Configuration

For full functionality including real-time trading, you'll need to set up the following API keys:

1. **Copy the sample environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp env.sample .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file** with your API keys:

#### Essential APIs
- **Alpaca API Keys** (Required for trading):
  - Sign up at [Alpaca Markets](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup)
  - Get your API key and secret from the dashboard
  - Set `ALPACA_USE_PAPER=True` for paper trading (recommended for testing)
  - Set `ALPACA_USE_PAPER=False` for live trading with real money

- **OpenAI API Key** (Default LLM provider and OpenAI web-search tools):
  - Sign up at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  - Default models are `gpt-5.4-nano` and `gpt-5.4-mini`

#### LLM Provider APIs
Set `LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env`, the CLI, or the WebUI. Supported providers include:
- **OpenAI**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Local OpenAI-compatible**: `OPENAI_USE_LOCAL=true`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, optional `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Google Gemini**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

  - Sign up at [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/cryptopian/api-keys)

#### Optional APIs
- **Alpha Vantage API Key** (Optional fallback market data):
  - Get from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
  - Fallback routing is optional and does not replace Alpaca as the primary market data path

#### Runtime Paths
`env.sample` also documents optional runtime paths:
- `TRADINGAGENTS_RESULTS_DIR` for report output
- `TRADINGAGENTS_CACHE_DIR` for cache and checkpoint files
- `TRADINGAGENTS_MEMORY_LOG_PATH` for persistent decision memory

3. **Restart the application** after setting up your API keys.

> **Note**: Without valid Alpaca API keys, the application will fall back to demo mode without trading capabilities.
> Trend-horizon Alpaca execution gating is enforced in the WebUI; the CLI remains analysis-only even when trend execution semantics are enabled for prompts and logging.

### CLI Usage

You can try out the CLI by running:
```bash
python -m cli.main
```

The CLI now supports multiple symbols and crypto assets:
- Single stock: `NVDA`
- Single crypto: `BTC/USD`
- Multiple mixed assets: `NVDA, ETH/USD, AAPL, BTC/USD`
- Provider/model selection, custom model IDs, checkpoint resume, trading horizon selection, and provider-specific settings are available from the CLI prompts.
- For `position` and `trend` horizons, the CLI can mark runs as execution-enabled for prompt/log semantics, but it still does not place Alpaca orders.

### Web UI Usage

Launch the enhanced Dash-based web interface:

```bash
python run_webui_dash.py --port 7860
```

If you open the app through a preview/proxy URL, start it with the same base
path so Dash serves its assets and callback endpoints under that prefix:

```bash
python run_webui_dash.py --port 7860 --base-path /proxy/7860/
```

Common options:
- `--port PORT`: Specify a custom port (default: 7860)
- `--base-path PATH`: Serve Dash under a URL prefix for preview/proxy access, for example `/proxy/7860/`
- `--share`: Create a public link to share with others
- `--server-name`: Specify the server name/IP to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--debug`: Run in debug mode with more logging
- `--max-threads N`: Set the maximum number of threads (default: 40)

or launch it with Docker:

```bash
cp env.sample .env
# Edit .env with your provider, market data, and Alpaca credentials first.
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts a local web server at http://localhost:7860. To use a different
host port, set `HOST_PORT`, for example `HOST_PORT=7861 docker compose up -d --build`.

### Prompt Customization

Model-facing prompts live in `tradingagents/prompts/templates`. Edit those
Markdown templates to tune analyst, researcher, trader, risk, signal extraction,
and reflection behavior from one place. Templates are grouped by role:
`analysts/`, `researchers/`, `managers/`, `trader/`, `risk/`, `trading_modes/`,
`graph/`, and `shared/`.

To keep custom prompts outside the repo, copy selected templates to another
folder and set `TRADINGAGENTS_PROMPT_DIR` to that path. Keep the same group path
for overrides, for example `analysts/market_system.md`. Missing files fall back
to the bundled templates.

#### Enhanced Web UI Features

The web interface offers comprehensive trading and analysis capabilities:

**Multi-Asset Analysis Dashboard**
- Analyze multiple stocks and crypto assets simultaneously
- Real-time progress tracking for each symbol
- Support for mixed portfolios (e.g., `"NVDA, ETH/USD, AAPL"`)

## AlpacaTradingAgent Package

### Implementation Details

Built with LangGraph for flexibility and modularity. The enhanced version integrates with multiple financial APIs and supports both paper and live trading through Alpaca. We recommend `gpt-5-nano` for the cheapest testing runs or `gpt-5.4-nano` for a newer low-cost default, as the framework makes numerous API calls across all 5 agents.

### Python Usage

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize with default config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# Analyze a single stock
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)

# Analyze multiple assets including crypto
symbols = ["NVDA", "ETH/USD", "AAPL"]
for symbol in symbols:
    _, decision = ta.propagate(symbol, "2024-05-10")
    print(f"{symbol}: {decision}")
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create custom config for enhanced features
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.4-mini"  # Balanced current default
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.4-nano"  # New low-cost quick model
config["quick_llm_params"] = {
    "reasoning_effort": "low",
    "text_verbosity": "low",
    "reasoning_summary": "auto",
}
config["deep_llm_params"] = {
    "reasoning_effort": "medium",
    "text_verbosity": "medium",
    "reasoning_summary": "auto",
}
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2  # Increase debate rounds
config["online_tools"] = True  # Use real-time data
config["allow_shorts"] = False  # Investment mode: BUY/HOLD/SELL
config["checkpoint_enabled"] = False  # Enable to resume failed graph runs
config["memory_log_path"] = "~/.tradingagents/memory/trading_memory.md"
config["news_global_openai_enabled"] = False  # Macro handles broad global context by default

# Parallel execution settings (to avoid API overload)
config["parallel_analysts"] = True  # Run analysts in parallel (default: True)
config["analyst_start_delay"] = 0.5  # Delay between starting each analyst (seconds)
config["analyst_call_delay"] = 0.1  # Delay before making analyst calls (seconds)
config["tool_result_delay"] = 0.2  # Delay between tool results and next call (seconds)

# Initialize with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)

# Analyze with crypto support
_, decision = ta.propagate("BTC/USD", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```

For non-OpenAI providers, switch the provider and model IDs:

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "google"
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gemini-2.5-flash"
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gemini-3.1-pro-preview"
config["google_thinking_level"] = "high"

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```
